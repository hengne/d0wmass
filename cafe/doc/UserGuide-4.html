<P>Putting all your analysis code into a single function or even a
<CODE>TSelector</CODE> method is not very scalable. Usually you have lots
of tasks which you want to run either separately or together,
maybe even in a different order.</P>
<P>Sharing and reusing code is very difficult in this way, since all you can do is
copy and paste other people's code and modify it to make it work in
your environment. </P>
<P>The CAF Environment framework provides the common functionality needed
to implement most of the above things in a consistent way. By following
a few simple rules, you can extend the framework in a well-defined
way and mix and match your code with code that other people have written.</P>
<P>The framework also provides services for configuration and transparent
access to files via SAM.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="UserGuide.html#toc4.1">Concepts <B>[BEGINNER]</B> </A>
</H2>

<P>The basic unit in the framework is a so-called <CODE>Processor</CODE>. In
its most simple form it has a method that takes a 
<CODE>cafe::Event</CODE> object and returns a <CODE>bool</CODE>.</P>
<P>The user can specify a series of <CODE>Processor</CODE>s that will be
executed for each event. If any of them returns <CODE>false</CODE>,
the processing of the event stops at this point.</P>
<P>The <CODE>Processor</CODE> objects are orchestrated by another
entity called a <CODE>Controller</CODE>. <CODE>Controller</CODE>s are
themselves a <CODE>Processor</CODE> and they can be
nested, i.e. a <CODE>Controller</CODE> can contain other <CODE>Controller</CODE>s.</P>
<P>The most common <CODE>Controller</CODE> is the <CODE>Group</CODE>. All it does
is execute its children in order. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="UserGuide.html#toc4.2">Writing your own Processors <B>[BEGINNER]</B> </A>
</H2>

<P>Most of these concepts will become clearer in the following
examples. From now on we assume that you are working
in a compiled environment rather than the root interpreter.</P>
<P>You should start by creating a new package for these exercises:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   % cd work
   % ctnewpkg -l my_examples
   % ( cd include; ln -s ../my_examples/my_examples )
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Then, as usual, put your header files into the <CODE>my_examples/my_examples</CODE>
subdirectory and the source files into <CODE>my_examples/src</CODE>. All your
source files should be named in the <CODE>COMPONENTS</CODE> file. In addition
you should add <CODE>root</CODE> to the LIBDEPS file.</P>
<P>Note that we don't have any <CODE>bin</CODE> directory. As you will see
we won't need it.</P>

<H3>Simple Functions</H3>


<P>Let's start with a very simple example: we want to print out the
event number for each event in a file. This should not be a 
big programming task. Write a file <CODE>src/PrintEventNo.cpp</CODE>
like this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>

#include &lt;iostream>
#include "cafe/Event.hpp"
#include "cafe/Function.hpp"

bool PrintEventNo(cafe::Event&amp; event) 
{
    const TMBGlobal *global = event.getGlobal();
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Event no: " &lt;&lt; global->evtno() &lt;&lt; std::endl;    
    return true;
}

CAFE_FUNCTION(PrintEventNo)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>That's it. Notice the <CODE>CAFE_FUNCTION</CODE> macro at the end. You'll need this to register
your function with the cafe environment.</P>
<P>Now type <CODE>make</CODE> and check that the build system
created the <CODE>shlib/$SRT_SUBDIR/libmy_example.so</CODE> library.</P>
<P>You can now execute this function in the framework by running
the following command:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   % cafe Input: input.root Run: PrintEventNo Packages: my_example
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Note that there is no need for linking. In fact, we are going
to use the same executable <CODE>cafe</CODE> for all our
programs from now on ! It will load our newly compiled shared
library at run-time and execute the function we have specified
on the command line.</P>
<P>The return value of the function is false if the framework should
stop the processing of the event at this point, true otherwise.</P>
<P>The funny arguments are explained later in the section about the
configuration file syntax. Basically, the command line consists of a
list of (<CODE>name</CODE>, <CODE>value</CODE>) pairs. The above says: </P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use <CODE>input.root</CODE> as the input file.</LI>
<LI>Run the <CODE>PrintEventNo</CODE> function on each event.</LI>
<LI>Load the package <CODE>my_example</CODE> before execution.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Subclasses of <CODE>Processor</CODE></H3>


<P>The method above is only good enough for very simple tasks. Usually
the user needs to have more information about the actual processing, e.g.
when new files are opened and closed, etc. In this case, she can
inherit directly from the <CODE>cafe::Processor</CODE> base class and implement
any of the virtual methods provided there. One of them is the <CODE>processEvent(cafe::Event&amp; event)</CODE>
method which is called for every event. There are, however, a few more available:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  
 class Processor {
    virtual void begin();
    virtual void finish();
    virtual void inputFileOpened(TFile *file);
    virtual void inputFileClosing(TFile *file);
    virtual bool processEvent(cafe::Event&amp; event);
    int  eventCount() const;
};
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>begin()</CODE> and <CODE>finish()</CODE> methods are called at the beginning
and end of the processing. They can be used to create objects like histograms and
save them at the end. The
<CODE>inputFileOpened()</CODE> and <CODE>inputFileClosed()</CODE> methods inform
about the opening and closing of input files. </P>
<P>Finally, the <CODE>eventCount</CODE> method returns the number of events that
this object has processed. This is such a common task, that the framework
keeps track of it and uses it at the end to print out the event counts
of the various steps. If a <CODE>Processor</CODE> implements a filter with
an analysis cut, this is a quick way to look at the result.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="UserGuide.html#toc4.3">Input Specifications <B>[BEGINNER]</B> </A>
</H2>


<P>The <CODE>Input:</CODE> argument to <CODE>cafe</CODE> can be any of the following:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a single filename (optionally prefixed with <CODE>file:</CODE>), example: <CODE>file:data.root</CODE> or just <CODE>data.root</CODE></LI>
<LI>a file with a list of filenames, example: <CODE>listfile:mydata.lst</CODE></LI>
<LI>a SAM dataset definition, example <CODE>sam:My2MUSkim</CODE></LI>
<LI>any other prefix known to ROOT, e.g. <CODE>http:</CODE>, <CODE>rootk:</CODE> etc.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Note: the files in a file list can in turn have any known ROOT file prefix, but not another file list or 
a SAM definition.</P>
<P>Some examples:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   % cafe Input: file:test.root
   % cafe Input: sam:MyDataSet
   % cafe Input: listfile:myfiles.lst
   % cafe Input: rootk://wensley-clued0.fnal.gov/work/wensley-clued0/data.root
</PRE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="UserGuide.html#toc4.4">Run Specifications <B>[BEGINNER]</B> </A>
</H2>


<P>The <CODE>Run:</CODE> argument takes a list of <CODE>Processor</CODE>s like this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   % cafe Input: data.root Run: PrintEventNo,MyFilter,Muon_PT_Histo
</PRE>
</P>
<P>In the simplest case, the names you specify on the command line are just the names
of the functions and classes you wrote for your analysis. In this case it is also the value
of the string parameter given to your class in the constructor. </P>
<P>Sometimes, however, it is useful to have more than one instance of the same class run. 
As long as the classes don't need to be distinguished (e.g for the names of the histograms
they write out), you don't care. Otherwise, you need a way to give each a unique name.
You do this with the following syntax:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  % cafe Input: data.root Run: 'Muon_PT_Histo(first),Muon_PT_Histo(second)'
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This syntax is supposed to mimic calling the constructor of <CODE>Muon_PT_Hist</CODE> with
the string <CODE>first</CODE> as name. In a C++ program you would say something like:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
    Processor *p = new Muon_PT_Histo("first");
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If the <CODE>Muon_PT_Hist</CODE> class uses the string passed to its constructor in naming
the histograms, you can distinguish their output, one of them using "first_" as prefix,
the other "second_":</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   Muon_PT_Hist::Muon_PT_Hist(const char * name) 
   {
      string histoName = string(name) + "_muon_pt";
      hist = new TH1F(histName.c_str(), "Muon pT", 0.0, 100.0, 100);
      // ...
   }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Note that you have to enclose the argument in quotes. This is because the '(' has 
a special meaning for the shell. If you quote the parameter, you can use either space or comma 
to separate the <CODE>Processor</CODE>s. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="UserGuide.html#toc4.5">Non-Persistent Data in <CODE>cafe:Event</CODE>  <B>[BEGINNER]</B> </A>
</H2>


<P>A quite common need is the ability to share information between different
<CODE>Processor</CODE>s. Instead of using global variables, the <CODE>cafe::Event</CODE> class
provides a light weight way of passing information from one step to
another.</P>
<P>You can store any object (or simple type) in <CODE>cafe::Event</CODE>, provided
that the object has a copy constructor and assignment defined. Each object is 
stored together with a <EM>key</EM> consisting of a string.</P>
<P>Here is how you store a simple integer number:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
    event.put("myNumber", 5);
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Any other <CODE>Processor</CODE> later in the chain can access this value like this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
    int value;
    if(event.get("myNumber", value)) { 
      // use 'value'
    } else {
      err() &lt;&lt; "myNumber not found in Event" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>There is always a copy operation involved in both storing and retrieving the value,
so the operation is quite general, but potentially expensive. You might try to
circumvent this problem by storing only a pointer in the event. In this case the question
of ownership arises. The default behaviour for the <CODE>cafe::Event</CODE> class is to
take ownership of any pointer you pass it. When all <CODE>Processor</CODE>s have been called
for the current event, the <CODE>Event::clear()</CODE> method is called, which deletes
any user pointer stored in the event.</P>
<P>So the following is quite safe as far as memory leaks are concerned:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
    MyObject *obj = new MyObject(...);
    event.put("myobject", obj);
</PRE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6</A> <A HREF="UserGuide.html#toc4.6">Tagging Events <B>[BEGINNER]</B> </A>
</H2>


<P>A very common piece of information which is passed around between <CODE>Processors</CODE>s is
a <EM>Tag</EM>. This is just a string that marks a specific event. There are default
methods to tag an event and check for the existence of tags. </P>
<P>Here is how you tag an event:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   event.tag("2MU");
</PRE>
</P>
<P>A tag is just a string which you can attach to an event. You can tag an event
with as many tags as you like.</P>
<P>Here is how you check for the existences of a tag:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   if(event.hasTag("2MU")) {
       // do something with event
   }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>You can also check for the existence of any of a list of tags:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   std::list&lt;std::string> tags;
   // fill tags
   if(event.hasTag(tags)) {
      // do something with event
   }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The latter method works with any STL container. I.e. you can store the tag list in
a <CODE>list</CODE>, a <CODE>vector</CODE> or a  <CODE>deque</CODE>, the implementation doesn't care.</P>
