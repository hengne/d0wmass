The zee background can be calculated by running runzee.C with a root file made from the EMMET data skim. Running this macro will give the numbers needed for the equation: 

Total predicted Zee events = # of events with 2nd object in ICD/ (object efficiency * mass window acceptance)

Need to update wenucomp.cpp and plot_util with a new background roottuple and a background fraction, respectively
