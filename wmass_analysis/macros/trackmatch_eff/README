plot_Efficiency_CountingTrks.Full.MC.LUMISPLIT.C
plot_Efficiency_TP.FullMC.C
read config-customized wmass_analysis output histograms and produce
track match efficiency curves for full MC 
(included in RunIIb QCD background note )
corresponding macros for 
background-subtracted efficiency for DATA
are in
/wzfitter/updates20082009/ptdependent_bkgsubtrackted_trkmatcheff

note that all of the above concerns tight track match efficiency
as a function of PT.

for loose track match efficiency we use wtree and ztree instead
of histograms (see below --
tight track match efficiency is reproduced
with macros below that run on wtree and ztree
and loose track match efficiency is calculated in
a similar way) 


runzlong.C and runwlong.C:
read ttrees and make pt spectrum plot under cut flow of many cuts
output: canvas with plots still in ROOT session

runz.C and runw.C:
calculate track match efficiencies from same ttrees as above
(to choose b/w tight and loose track match efficiency
need to edit these file;
be careful with cc-fid requirement
and how they combine with track match requirements)
output: efficiency histograms and other relevant histograms
are saved in the root file


plot_z_and_w_eff.C
loop over several root files produced by runz.C and runw.C
(one file -- one variable, e.g. pte, lumi, etc.)
and plot either efficiency or denominator, or numerator,
or product of efficiencies
z and w histograms overlaid.
Has two main modes:
-- #define EFFICIENCY_9VAR
    this one was used for MC efficiencies
-- #define EFFICIENCYANDRATIO
   this one was used to make plot of pte, lumi, set
   on one canvas; in this mode the macro may need
   to be run twice if one wants to display
   polynomial fits: first produce the ratios
   and save them in .C file, then insert this .C
   file in fitwithpol3_and_save_fitresults.C
   and follow instructions that are there to fit the ratios,
   and save fit results (central values, +- 1 sigma curves)
   in root files; then run plot_z_and_w_eff.C again,
   this time also drawing the functions just described


fitwithpol3_and_save_fitresults.C
this is kind of a template,
copy and paste body of .C file with canvas and histograms
produced with plot_z_and_w_eff.C run in EFFICIENCYANDRATIO mode,
then follow instructions written inside fitwithpol3_and_save_fitresults.C;
this is made for three pads now (three variables), need to run
once per pad with modifications described inside fitwithpol3_and_save_fitresults.C;
output are root files, again, one per pad, with 3-rd order
polynomial fits to historam ratios.




runzregions.C
read z ttree and fill histograms of many variables
split into three kinematic regions
output: root file with histograms

plotzregions.C
read rootfile produced by runzregions.C
and produce plots for each variable
(three histograms overlaid)
output: .eps and .gif file for each variable
these .eps and .gif files are then used in
/work/bhatia-clued0/melnit/public/080410/zregions.html

similarly for wen events from wtree made by WAnalysis use 
runwregions.C
plotwregions.C
