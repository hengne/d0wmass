** Read before you use v15 SPCs **

The Tau SPC files had offline tau NN cuts of 0.9,0.9,0.95, respectively, 
so if analyzers aren't going to use those cuts, the tau object efficiencies 
should be remeasured relative to those new cuts.

The Single MU OR files were done with probe pT cut down to 10 GeV.
